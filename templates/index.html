							<p>&emsp;The primary purpose of the Frenzy is to kill or otherwise neutralize the stimulus responsible for it, so a vampire driven to Frenzy will attempt to feed on anything she can catch whereas a character entering frenzy in combat will attempt to kill all nearby combatants.</p> 
							<p>&emsp;All difficulties to Dominate or otherwise mentally control a frenzied character are increased by two, and all difficulties to resist the effects of such mental control are reduced by two. The character never needs Willpower rolls to accomplish a feat, because the rage fueling the vampire’s actions is both a catalyst to heightened state of mind and a barrier against unwanted intrusions.</p>

The scale of the personal problem isn’t important; the Salubri understands that sometimes suffering is part of a cumulative situation and not an isolated stimulus. Any action not taken toward mitigating that personal tragedy incurs a two dice penalty.

							<li class='no-bullet'>
								<div class='header clan-compulsion-header'>Toreador</div>
								<div class='hidden'><span class='title'>Obsession</span> - enraptured by beauty, the vampire becomes temporarily obsessed with a singular gorgeous thing, able to think of nothing else. Pick one feature, such as a person, a song, an artwork, blood spatter, or even a sunrise. Enraptured, the vampire can hardly take their attention from it, and if spoken to, they only talk about that subject. Any other actions receive a two-dice penalty. This Compulsion lasts until they can no longer perceive the beloved object or the scene ends.</div>
							</li>
							<br/>
							<li class='no-bullet'>
								<div class='header clan-compulsion-header'>Tremere</div> 
								<div class='hidden'><span class='title'>Perfectionism</span> - nothing but the best satisfies the vampire. Anything less than exceptional performance instills a profound sense of failure, and they often repeat tasks obsessively to get them "just right". Until the vampire scores a critical win on a Skill roll or the scene ends, the vampire labors under a two-dice penalty to all dice pools. The penalty is reduced to one die for a repeated action and removed entirely on a second repeat.</div>
							</li>
							<br/>
							<li class='no-bullet'>
								<div class='header clan-compulsion-header'>Tzimisce</div> 
								<div class='hidden'><span class='title'>Covetousness</span> - when a Tzimisce suffers a Compulsion, the Kindred becomes obsessed with possessing something in the scene, desiring to add it to their proverbial hoard. This can be anything from an object to a piece of property to an actual person. Any action not taken toward this purpose incurs a two-dice penalty. The Compulsion persists until ownership is established (the Storyteller decides what constitutes ownership in the case of a non-object) or the object of desire becomes unattainable.</div>
							</li>
							<br/>
							<li class='no-bullet'>
								<div class='header clan-compulsion-header'>Ventrue</div>
								<div class='hidden'><span class='title'>Arrogance</span> - the need to rule rears its head in the vampire. They stop at nothing to assume command of a situation. Someone must obey an order from the vampire. Any action not directly associated with leadership receives a two-dice penalty. This Compulsion lasts until an order has been obeyed, though the order must not be supernaturally enforced, such as through Dominate.</div>
